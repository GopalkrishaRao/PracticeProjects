## [Data Structure]:
* A data structure is a way of organizing, storing, and managing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently. 

#
## [Common types of Data Structure]:
1. **Arrays**: A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations, accessed by their index. Arrays offer fast access to elements but can be limited in size and require shifting elements when inserting or deleting.

2. **Linked Lists**: A linear data structure where each element (node) contains a value and a reference to the next node. Linked lists allow for dynamic resizing and efficient insertions and deletions, but accessing elements requires traversing the list from the beginning.

3. **Stacks**: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added and removed from the same end. Stacks are commonly used for managing function calls, expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms.

4. **Queues**: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front. Queues are used in scenarios like task scheduling, breadth-first search, and handling asynchronous events.

5. **Trees**: A hierarchical data structure composed of nodes connected by edges. Trees are used for hierarchical representation, searching, and sorting operations. Common types include binary trees, AVL trees, and Red-Black trees.

6. **Graphs**: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Graphs are used for representing complex relationships, such as social networks, transportation networks, and network topologies.

7. **Hash Tables**: A data structure that stores key-value pairs and allows efficient retrieval based on the keys. Hash tables provide fast access and insertion but can have collision resolution challenges.

## [Algorithm]:
*  Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a specific problem or perform a particular task.

#
## [Time complexity]:
* Time complexity is a concept used in the analysis of algorithms to measure how the running time of an algorithm grows with respect to the size of the input data. It quantifies the amount of time an algorithm takes to exec ute as a function of the input size.

#
## [Space complexlity]:
* Exra splce required to solve the probem propotional to input size.
